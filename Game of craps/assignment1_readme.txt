
To compile the code and generate the output file please follow the following instructions:
1. Copy the code in the compiler and update the output file location according to your system. The output file will be generated at that location with name 'archana_output_file.txt'.
2. Run the code through any java compiler or tool like 'Eclipse' or 'Netbeans'.

According to me, Strategy 2; 'Martingale System' works the best as it provides greater probability to win larger amount.
